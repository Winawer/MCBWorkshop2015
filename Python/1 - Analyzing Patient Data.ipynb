In this case, that output is the data we just loaded. By default, only a few rows and columns are shown (with ... to omit elements when displaying big arrays). To save space, Python displays numbers as 1. instead of 1.0 when there’s nothing interesting after the decimal point.\n",

We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using =. As an illustration, let’s step back and instead of considering a table of data, consider the simplest “collection” of data, a single value.
