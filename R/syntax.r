# Exercise 4: create a variable, and assign a number to it. Now square the value assigned to that variable. Output the variable.**

dummyVector=c(4, 12, 1.3, 15, 0.1, 2.5, 7, 55)
# Exercise 5: add numbers to dummyVector. Subtract. Divide. What happens if you add a vector containing 2 numbers to dummyVector? or 3? Finally, perform a mathematical operation on dummyVector to turn all values to 1**
dummyVector+1
dummyVector/3
dummyVector/dummyVector

#Exercise 6: access the 1st, 3rd, and 5th values in dummyVector (hint, you'll need to use a vector inside the square brackets). Add 10 to only those values. What happens if you change the first variable in dummyVector to "G"?**

#Exercise 7: Some genius from Lockheed Martin measured the height of our friends' gardenias in inches, not centimeters. Given that an inch is 2.54 cm, convert the "height" column to centimeters. Quick! Before the gardenias crash into Mars and all is lost.**
print(gardenia)
h_cm=gardenia=gardenia[,"height"]*2.54


#Exercise 8: add the new height in centimeters column to the gardenia dataframe using column bind, or cbind(). Change the column names to reflect that one measure of height is in cm, the other in inches using colnames()**
gardenia=data.frame(gardenia, h_cm)
colnames(gardenia)=c("name", "h_in", "leaf_number", "flowering_time", "h_cm")

#Exercise 9: Find the order of values in the gardenia "height" column. Use this resulting vector to sort the table. Print the rows containing just the 3 tallest plants**
gardenia=gardenia[order(gardenia[,"height"]),]

#Exercise 9: make a csv file we can actually use. Read it in, and call it snark.**
snark=read.csv("./data_files/snark.csv")

#**Exercise 10: Print the rows containing just the people from USC**  
gardenia[which(gardenia[,"uni"]=="usc",]

#**Exercise 11: Read in both files of snark data. Stick them together using rbind and call the resulting dataset "snark". Save it as snark.csv, in the data_file folder.**
snark=read.csv("./data_files/snark.csv", sep=",", header=T, strip.white=T, as.is=T)

#**Exercise 12: Can you change the sex coding to something sensible using which()?**

snark[which(snark[,"sex"]=="female"),2]=0
snark[which(snark[,"sex"]=="m"),2]=1
snark[which(snark[,"sex"]=="male"),2]=1  

#**Exercise 14: the Snarks need individual id numbers. Create an id column (hint, all you need is c() and a range), and add it to the dataset using cbind()**
ind=c(1:nrow(snark))
snark=cbind(snark[,1:3], ind, snark[4:length(snark)])


#**Exercise 15: Use a for-loop, and print max() and mean() summaries for all measurements for all days**
```{r}
head(snark)
for (i in 5:length(snark)){
  print(max(snark[,i], na.rm=T))  
  print(mean(snark[,i], na.rm=T))
}
```

#**Exercise 16: reshape the data and call it snarkLong**
```{r}
snarkLong=reshape(snark, varying=c(snark[,4:length(snark)]), timevar="day", idvar="id", sep="_")

```


#**Exercise 17 write linear models to test whether there is variation in growth rate of body and cephalocalypse by sex, population and family**

bodGrow=lm(bod~day+ sex +pop+family, data=snarkLong)
cephGrow=lm(a~day+ sex +pop+family, data=snarkLong)

# **Exercise 18: summarise n, mean, min, max, sd, area, and cephalocalypse:body ratio by sex, population and day**

             N= length(bod),
             aMean=mean(a, na.rm=T),
